# Car Auction Website

## Abstract

This project report presents the comprehensive design, development, and implementation of a dynamic car auction website, developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, PHP, and MySQL. The primary objective of the website is to create a robust platform that facilitates real-time search, online sales, and auctions of cars.

The website is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, enabling users to easily search for cars based on various criteria such as category, brand, price range, year, and mileage. Users can also list their cars for sale, participate in auctions, and manage their activities through features such as the cart and wishlist.

- Online sales: New cars can be added to the cart and purchased through a streamlined checkout process.
- Car auctions: Used cars can be auctioned, with a bidding system that includes a points mechanism to manage user participation.
- Location tracking: The website uses IP-based location tracking to enhance user experience and provide relevant information.
